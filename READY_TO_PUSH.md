## After Pushing

Your repository will transform from empty to a complete enterprise data platform!

Check it here:
https://github.com/Web8080/Comprehensive_Hospital_Care_Management_and_Analytics_Platform

---

## Troubleshooting

**"Authentication failed"**
- Make sure you're using a token (not your GitHub password)
- Token must have `repo` permissions

**"Permission denied (publickey)"**
- You chose SSH but don't have SSH keys set up
- Use Method 1 (Personal Access Token) instead

**"Remote already exists"**
- That's fine! Just run: `git push -u origin main`

---

## Quick Push Command

```bash
git push -u origin main
```

That's it! Enter your username (`Web8080`) and token when prompted.
