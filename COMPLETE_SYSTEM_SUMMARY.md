   - Use Loom or QuickTime
   - Walk through search → care plan → activity log
   - Show charts and interactivity

3. **Prepare Talking Points**
   - "I chose star schema because..." (query performance, BI tool compatibility)
   - "I used SCD Type 2 for..." (tracking historical changes)
   - "The daily activity log with comments field..." (real clinical workflow)
   - "Matillion is ideal because..." (visual ETL, Snowflake integration)

4. **GitHub Repository**
   - Push all code
   - Add screenshots to README
   - Include demo video link
   - Add badges (Python, Snowflake, Streamlit)

## Troubleshooting

### "Database connection failed"
- Check that data generation completed
- Click "Initialize Database from CSV"
- Delete `.duckdb` file and restart

### "Module not found"
- Run: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### "No data in charts"
- Verify CSV files exist in `data/raw/`
- Check console for SQL errors
- Try re-initializing database

### Dashboard is slow
- Reduce `NUM_PATIENTS` in `config.py` to 100
- Add indexes to frequently queried columns
- Use aggregate tables
