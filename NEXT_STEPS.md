## 2. Connect to Snowflake + Matillion (Production)

### Timeline: 4-6 hours total

**Step 1: Snowflake Setup (1 hour)**

What you need to do:
1. Sign up: https://signup.snowflake.com
   - Choose: Standard, AWS, US East
   - Save: account URL, username, password

2. Create database structure:
   - Run SQL from `sql/schema/gold_schema.sql`
   - Create BRONZE, SILVER, GOLD schemas

3. Upload CSV files:
   - 15 files from `data/raw/` folder
   - Use Snowflake web UI: "Load Data" button
   - Upload to BRONZE schema

**Step 2: Matillion Setup (2 hours)**

What you need to do:
1. Sign up: https://www.matillion.com/try-now/
   - Select "Matillion ETL for Snowflake"
   - Connect to your Snowflake account

2. Create ETL jobs:
   - Job 1: Bronze → Silver (data cleaning)
   - Job 2: Silver → Gold (star schema)
   - Copy SQL from `sql/matillion_transformations.sql`

3. Run jobs:
   - Test each job
   - Verify GOLD schema is populated

**Step 3: Update Dashboard (30 minutes)**

What you need to do:
1. Create `.env` file with Snowflake credentials
2. Update: `DATABASE_TYPE=snowflake`
3. Install: `pip install snowflake-connector-python`
4. Test connection
5. Restart Streamlit

**Step 4: Deploy to Cloud (30 minutes)**

What you need to do:
1. Push code to GitHub (already done)
2. Deploy to Streamlit Cloud
3. Add Snowflake secrets
4. Access public URL

**Detailed instructions:** See `GET_STARTED_NOW.md`
