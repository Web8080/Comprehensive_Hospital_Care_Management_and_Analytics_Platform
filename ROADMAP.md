**For Phase 3:**
- Which ML framework? (scikit-learn, XGBoost, PyTorch?)
- How to explain model predictions to clinicians? (SHAP values?)

**For Phase 4:**
- Self-managed Kafka or managed service?
- How to handle streaming failures?

**For Phase 5:**
- Focus on breadth (all features) or depth (fewer features, better quality)?
